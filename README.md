# Front-end Setup

This is a template I use for my own projects, trying to optimize grunt, including Foundation, Animate.css and Font-awesome.


##What's included?

Beside the main features mentioned above, I try my best to optimize the performance, therefore I use:

* Uglify (`npm install grunt-contrib-uglify`)
* Concat (`npm install grunt-contrib-concat`)
* Jshint (`npm install grunt-contrib-jshint`)
* AutoPrefixer (`npm install grunt-autoprefixer`)

## Requirements

* Sass (`gem install sass`)
